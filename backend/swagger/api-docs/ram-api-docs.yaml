        summary: Find party by invitation code        
        description: | 
          This service may be use to find a party with the specified invitation code (sub type of identity) and update details of that invitation
          code to signal it has been accepted, rejected, etc.  
          If the supplied invitation code details are correct, the status & claimedtimestamp propertie are update.
          The link id for the logged on user is populated into the identity property (together with profile info).
          This identity is used to find a Party record for the logged on user.
          if one is found the Relationship attached to the Party that contains the InvitationCode
          is transfered to the Party identified by the logged on user's Party
          if one isn't found the Identity for the logged on user is attached to the Party that 
          owns the InvitationCode, and thus now the logged on user has a Party record.

        description: |
          In general RAM doesn't create Identity(s) (that is done by the credential service provider, etc),
          but it does create a record of that Identity in its database.  The exception to this is 
          RAM creates InvitationCode(s).  There is no service to create InvitationCode(s) as InvitationCode(s)
          cannot exist independantly of Relationship(s), therefore their creation is a side effect of
          creating a Relationship to an unidentified party.

            A LegislativeProgram represents some course-grained grouping of functionality offered by government to citizens. 
            Due to "Machinary of Government" changes these LegislativePrograms are moved between agencies. Generally, LegislativePrograms survive these moves, just in a newly named agency.
