## Development Environment Installation

* Create a (GitHub)[http://github.com] account if you do not already have one.
* Log in to your GitHub account
* Go to https://github.com/atogov/RAM
* Select the _Fork_ button from the top right
  * If you have not yet created a fork, you will be given that option now
    * Read https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ for instructions. This will give you a repository in your own account that synchronises from the ATO RAM repository. As you make changes, use pull requests to update the main repository. Don't forget to merge from ATO before creating a pull request back.

### Windows
* Download the Github downloader/installer
  * Click on https://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe
  * and accept the download to save it
  * Once downloaded, run the exe
* The GitHub GUI should open once install is complete
  * Change shell to Bash
    * Select the tool icon on the top right
    * Selection _Options..._ from the menu
    * In the _Default shell_ section, choose **Git Bash**
* While there configure your GitHub account, clone path, etc
    * Close the options
    * To use SourceTree for reviewing / merging pull requests, you need to modify _.git/config_ file as described [here](https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247). In short, add the following:
        [remote "atogov"]
            fetch = +refs/pull/\*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/\*
* Run a git bash shell
  * from the GitHub GUI client
    * Select the tool icon on the top right
    * Selection _Open in Git Shell_ from the menu
  * curl -SLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atogov/RAM/develop/install/ram-dev-win.sh
  * ./ram-dev-win.sh _your-github-name_
    * Clones a local copy of your FORK of RAM
    * Uses _npm/tsd/jspm_ to install dependencies
    * Installs MongoDB
    * Installs Node 6.x.x
    * Installs Visual Studio Code

## Windows Manual installation - Windows 7
 * Download and install latest version of MongoDB
 * Install python 2.7 and make sure it is also on the PATH 
 * Install NodeJs 6.x.x 
 * npm config set python python2.7 --global
 * npm config set msvs_version 2015 --global
 * Install VC++ Build Tools Technical Preview from http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691132, choose Custom Install, and select both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 SDKs.
 * npm install typescript tslint eslint gulp-cli jasmine jspm -g
 * cd backend; npm install
 * cd frontend; npm install; jspm install
 
## AWS Install

* Each server requires its own configuration file. Template configuration file at _conf/conf.js_. You must set an environment variable called *RAM_CONF* pointing to the absolute path of your configuration file.
Once you set your *RAM_CONF* environment variable you can run the server by calling _gulp serve_.

* SSH to the server
  * curl -SLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atogov/RAM/develop/install/aws.sh
  * **sudo bash aws-init.sh**
    * creates /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    * installs NGINX
    * installs Nodejs
    * installs MongoDB
    * creates /ram/update.sh
    * runs /ram/update.sh
      * downloads and unpacks latest copy of RAM from GitHub
      * _npm update_ to update dependencies
      * restart RAM server

### From the Server

SSH to the server and run _/ram/update.sh hhhhhh_ where **hhhhhh** is the hash of the commit you want to run. It can also be a tag or branch name. If not supplied, _develop_ is used.

### From the UI (Dev env only)

From a browser run http://ramvm01.expoctest.com/dev. Enter a branch/tag/hash and press the appropriate button.

## The Development Process

* Fork and clone https://github.com/atogov/RAM if you haven't already. This need only be done once per developer.
* Open Git Shell
* Run _./ram-unix.sh backend server&_
* Run _./ram-unix.sh frontend server&_
* Wait patentially. Eventually a browser page will open
* For each task:
  * Refresh your clone from RAM or another fork if that is the base you need.
  * Repeat...
    * Enable tests you want to work on.
    * Run Jasmine for a service called _nnnnn_. If the optional describe text is provided, only the _describe()_ that matches the text will run. Otherwise all tests in the file execute.
    * If it fails, add code to one of the service actions

## The ```ram-unix``` script

At the root of the project, there is a ```ram-unix``` script which provides a self documenting list of useful commands from setting up the environment to running the frontend/backend and executing tests. You can see the list of commands simply by executing:

* ```./ram-unix```

Here is a list of support commands:

```Usage:

    ram-unix <command>

Commands:

    setup                                      Setups local workstation
    deps                                       Download all dependencies
    deps:frontend                              Download frontend dependencies
    deps:backend                               Download backend dependencies
    deps:test                                  Download api test dependencies

    test:backend                               Runs backend tests
    test:api                                   Runs API tests

    start:frontend                             Starts local frontend server
    start:backend                              Starts local backend server

    db:drop                                    Drops local database
    db:seed                                    Seeds local database

    clean                                      Cleans all generated files
    swagger                                    Opens browser to swagger apis on local server
    staging                                    Opens browser to staging instance
    github                                     Opens browser to github repository
    wiki                                       Opens browser to project wiki
    merge:upstream <branch>                    Merges from upstream, <value> is branch name (eg develop)
```

For the ```test```, you can limit the test by a pattern. For example:

```./ram-unix test:backend --test relationshipType.model```

## Jasmine from the Client
You may prefer to test your service from a browser. You can then select individual tests as needed. The browser will need to include

* _RAM/microservices/node_modules/ram/service/request.js_
* _RAM/microservices/nnnnn/spec.js_

## PM2 - Production Process Manager

Full use has yet to be explored. For development the watch can be set to restart on file changes. To do this we need to set up environments so that it only does so on development. This is a matter of setting and using environent variable within _ecosystem.json_.

## JSPM & Travis

While using jspm, specifically `jspm install` you can run into the error `GitHub rate limit reached.`. This is due to
github rate limiting by IP address, which happens quite often while using Travis.

This is the [recommended solution from jspm](http://jspm.io/docs/registries.html):

- login to github
- create a personal access key with the `public_repo` scope
- run on your computer `jspm registry config github` and enter your github login and access key
- export the auth key defined after `jspm config registries.github.auth `
- login to travis to your fork and create the environment variable `JSPM_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` and set this jspm auth key

## Travis

While working on the travis configuration file you can validate it using the following commands

- `rvm install 2.1.5`
- `rvm gemset create ram`
- `rvm use 2.1.5@ato-ram`
- `gem install travis`
- `travis lint`
